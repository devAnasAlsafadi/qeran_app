/// Everything the formal step contributes to a stage-1 or stage-2 card.
///
/// Extracted rather than branched in place: stages 1 and 2 both host the
/// formal step and would otherwise each carry the same three-way branch. They
/// differ in their avatar treatment and their own status line — not in this.
///
/// Three states, and which one applies is the SERVER's answer, never a guess:
///   • nobody asked → the gold CTA, with the helper line under it.
///   • I asked → the retired "awaiting their approval" button + countdown.
///   • they asked ME → accept / decline + countdown, and no helper.
///
/// The third state's buttons live in
/// `match_card_formal_step_responder_actions.dart`. They were extracted when
/// this file reached 192 lines and sub-step 7 needed to add to it — the
/// standing rule is that the next change splits first rather than squeezing
/// under the cap. This file resolves WHICH state applies; that one draws the
/// only state complex enough to need a widget.
